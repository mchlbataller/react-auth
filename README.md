# react-authentication
## About this Project
This project is being made during my study in making React apps. This was specifically made so that I could understand the authentication process in Nodejs. <br>
## Future Plans
This will be the used as the future auth boilerplate for my future projects. Otherwise if there is already a library that is easier to implement than Passport.js, the library would be more preferred.
## Starting the development server
Run `yarn dev`.<br>
Profit.
